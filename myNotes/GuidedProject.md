Build a Server Rendered Website with Next.js

Now we will work on building a Server Rendered Website with Next.js.
We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

1. Set up the Next Project and Analyze Legacy Application.

2. Create an Index.js Page with CSS and set up Rendering.

3. Import Navigation components to a Next Application.

4. Convert the Existing Web Pages into Next Components to Render.

5. Add Next Links and CSS to each Component in the Next Application and Test.

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning.
