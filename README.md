I have not installed node as I used the Rhyme platform within Coursea which already has node installed. Hence why you don't see the node modules.
However, I have copied my code from the Rhyme platform to my VSCode locally. Then I have created new repo in my Github used this to publish my
code for my colleague to view/comment.

Course Objectives:
In this course, I will focus on three learning objectives:

1. Create an Index.js Page with CSS and set up Rendering.
2. Convert the Existing Web Pages into Next Component Pages to Render.

By the end of this course, I will create a Next Application from an existing website offering pet and house sitting services.
